USAFA Database Project

Summary: Focused of MySQL and php to create a database application

easySupt is a online form-1 for USAFA. It was never implemented across the school but does function.

Lost points for not doing server side validation of certain data constraints and because we implemented a fake way to remove records from the database.

Developers: Gavin Delphia, Austin Hurley
